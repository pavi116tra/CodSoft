# 📩 SPAM SMS DETECTION

## 📖 Project Overview
Spam SMS Detection is a Machine Learning project that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Legitimate (Ham)**.  
The model analyzes the text content of messages and predicts whether a message is unwanted spam or a genuine message.

This project demonstrates the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and supervised machine learning algorithms.
